A nice lil bat script to copy files from a computer to the usb drive. Used it to retreive files in emergency when my friend's monitor was not working :D

1. Copy to a usb drive
2. Insert the usb drive
3. Win + R to open Run
4. enter the usb drive's script path Eg. E:\retreive.bat
5. you'll hear a bell once the files are copied.
